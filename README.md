Certainly! Here's a README.md template for the Credit Risk Modelling repository:

```markdown
# Credit Risk Modelling

## Overview
This repository contains the code and datasets used in the Credit Risk Analysis project. The aim of this project is to develop a model that can predict the probability of credit default based on historical data.

## Repository Contents
- `Credit Risk Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and modelling process.
- `credit_risk_dataset.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the predictive model.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atreyu595/Credit-Risk-Modelling.git
cd Credit-Risk-Modelling
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook to perform the analysis and generate the credit risk model.

```bash
jupyter notebook Credit Risk Analysis.ipynb
```
